# Part 1: 

H8ck3r T0ol5 (Hacker Tools) is developed to protect you and to destroy the SUSD! H8ck3r T0ol5 
has Exploits, Games, Tools, Scripts, Music, and more! Scripts can help you execute tools like a functioning calculator 
or a musical piano. This is just a better version of USTool and Turbo Games (my other games.) 

# Part 2: 

The Scripts button allows you to execute helpful scripts (JScript.) The Exploits button allows you to exploit your chromebook 
to be unenrolled (unb10ck3d.) The Music (music note) button allows you to download/play/stop music. The Tools button has tools 
like Secure Mode, Battery Saver, Change FPS, cloak tab, and more! The Gaming (controller) button allows you to access game, 
gaming, and unblocker links.
